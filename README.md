# Supervision-management-sdlc
A comprehensive software engineering analysis of the MSc Supervision Management System (MSMS) using the SDLC phases, Agile methodologies, Scrum framework, and modern development tools.
# MSc Supervision Management System (MSMS) – Software Analysis & Design

This project explores the software engineering process behind the **MSc Supervision Management System (MSMS)**, covering end-to-end development phases from requirement gathering to deployment and maintenance. The system is designed to streamline supervisor allocation, meeting scheduling, and progress tracking for postgraduate students.
